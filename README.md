# Predicting Selling Price of Cars

I used a dataset on kaggle to replicate a random forest regressor model that predicts the potential price of a car taking into account multiple variables. This is an end to end machine learning project to understand how to deploy an ml model onto a web application which was done with close reference to the video linked below. 

The main goal is to figure out how the deployment of an ml model is done for future projects
